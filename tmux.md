# TMUX

All commands in tmux are triggered by a **prefix key** followed by a **command key** (similar to emacs). By default, tmux uses `C-b` as prefix key. This notation might read a little weird if you're not used to it. In this emacs notation `C-` means "press and hold the `Ctrl` key". Thus `C-b` simply means press the `Ctrl` and `b` keys at the same time. [src](https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/)
